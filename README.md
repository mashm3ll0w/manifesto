This is is a test project to print a document line by line on the Terminal. 

```cat``` reads the contents of the _manifesto_ file and pipes (```|```) the script which instead of splashing all the contents on the ```stdout```, prints the lines one by one giving the illusion that it is being typed in real time. 

I've used [```The Hacker Manifesto```](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_Manifesto) because, why not?! Feel free to use anything you like.

_This is more of a note to myself_ : have this script run right after booting/logging into Linux as a sort of ```welcome``` :)


## How To Use

You must have bash installed although it comes pre-installed on many linux distros. For Windows users, there are tonnes of how-tos to help you set up bash in your system.



clone this repo anywhere you prefer
```
$ git clone https://mashm3ll0w.github.io/manifesto
```
get into the directory
```
$ cd manifesto
```
_read.sh_ prints the document line by line
```
$ cat manifesto | ./read.sh
```
_reed.sh_ prints the document but introduces typos and tries to rectify them
```
$ cat manifesto | ./reed.sh

```
