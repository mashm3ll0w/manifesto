This is is a test project to print a document line by line on the Terminal. I've used ```The Hacker Manifesto``` because, why not?!

_This is more of a note to myself_
Have this script after into linux as a sort of ```welcome``` :)


## How To Use

You must have bash installed although it comes pre-installed on many linux distros. For windows users, there are tonnes of how-tos to help you set up bash in your system.

```

##clone this repo anywhere you prefer

$ git clone https://mashm3ll0w.github.io/manifesto

##get into the directory

$ cd manifesto

##run the code using the first script (read.sh prints the document line by line)

$ cat manifesto | ./read.sh

##the second script, reed.sh, prints the document line by line but introduces typos and tries to rectify them

$ cat manifesto | ./reed.sh

```
